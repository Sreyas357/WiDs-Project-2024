# Project Begins
## Emotion Detector for large video datasets using CNN & RNN

As the project name suggests, we are going to make a Emotion Recognitor for a large video datasets, this is done by getting n number of frames from the video, on each frame we apply CNN to get emotion features and then apply RNN on these extracted features of each frame to get the final emotion in the video.

This is just a very brief intro to what we are going to implement in whole

And see clearly how the emotion is described in valence arousal space, you can look into below website for clarity

So please go through the paper (uploaded in the repo) to get a clear idea regarding the project

## Duration & Remarks

After the read, please start the Project !!

You will be doing this for 2 weeks (the final 2 weeks).

## Deliverables

- Report is a must, Contents of the report is as follows

This report must include the 'Main Idea' & 'Correctness' and 'Procedure' (large video sets to frames, design for corresponding model and etc.. based on the paper)

- Work until the deadline (Current Status)
