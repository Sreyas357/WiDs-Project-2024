# Project Begins
## Emotion Detector for large video datasets using CNN & RNN

As the project name suggests, we are going to make a Emotion Recognitor for a large video datasets, this is done by getting n number of frames from the video, CNN on the facial emotion and then RNN on the frames of the video to get the final emotion in the video

This is just a very brief intro to what we are going to implement in whole

So please go through the paper to get a clear idea to start off the project
