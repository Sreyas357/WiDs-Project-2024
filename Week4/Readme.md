## Emotion Detector for large video datasets using CNN & RNN

As the project name suggests, we are going to make a Emotion Recognitor for a large video datasets, this is done by getting n number of frames from the video, CNN on the facial emotion and then RNN on the frames of the video to get the final emotion in the video
