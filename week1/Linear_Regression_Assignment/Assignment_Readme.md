# Readme for Assignment-1

Implement the following using numpy, pandas and matplotlib (a kind of practice for your Basic Python)

Can use pytorch if you want !

## Q1

You have to implement Basic Linear Regression with the template given

So complete various functions like gradient_descent, train_model, the loss function .. and understand how a Basic Linear Regressor looks like

Try using various learning rates, also plot the loss vs iterations graphs for various learning rates

As a sanity check, you can compare the weights obtained after gradient descent and those given by closed-form
solution. Ideally, these should be very similar to each other

### Evaluation

Grading is done based on your accuracy i.e, loss for various learning rates

## Q2

You have to use basis functions to try and improve the modelâ€™s fit from Q1, the loss
for the second test comes to be huge. But if you try to plot the data points, you can see some polynomial resemblances

So trasform it using a Polynomial Basis Function, try it for various degrees(1-10) and get the optimal degree for the 2nd dataset.



You are given the template code in this part also, so you just need to link how things are done and complete the code snippets

### Evaluation

Grading is done based on accuracy for various degrees and printing out the correct optimal degree
