 This is a slightly lengthy assignment where you have tom implement basic NN,RNN,CNN from strach and using pytorch libraries ,
 And this will be combined assignment for Week 2 and 3 .

 I recommend you be read the working of their mechanisms carefully , and clearly understand the backpropagation in these 3.

For every question question description is mentioned , in case  you have  **any doubts post it on the group** .
